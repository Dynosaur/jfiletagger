# FileTagger

A Java Swing GUI application that allows you to add tags to files. Tags allow you to search and sort for files on your PC much easier.

This is a project I did just for my own purposes, and to brush up on my Java skills. Maintenance is not guaranteed, this is not a product.

## Building

### Requirements

1. [Java 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/)
  - I developed using Java 21 on a Windows 11 64-bit platform.

### Build

#### Windows

1. From the project root directory, run `.\scripts\run-windows.bat`. This will compile and then execute the program.
